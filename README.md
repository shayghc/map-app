# Neighbourhood Maps

This repo contains the code for the Neighbourhood Maps, Google API project for the React portion of the Udacity FEND course. The app displays several navy related places of interest in Portsmouth, UK. The city has a long history associated with the Royal Navy.

The sidebar (nav) will start closed on smaller screens to provide more real-estate for the map view. The text input can be used to filter the POIs available for view. The sidebar items will be prefixed by an alphabetical character that corresponds with its associated marker on the map.

Clicking on a sidebar item will activate the marker and open an info window which will display address information from FourSquare, a third-party API. A subsequent click will close the window. On smaller screens, opening an info window will close the sidebar.

For users not using a mouse, the items can be activated by tabbing to the item and pressing enter. As with the mouse click, a second 'enter' will close the info window.

When the sidebar is hidden it can be revealed by clicking/pressing 'enter' on the 'hamburger' menu icon.
